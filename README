Give me some alternatives to storing PCB structs in an array. 

Write a function that finds the first empty pcb in the vector and returns its position.

Write a help message for this program

Summary: 
Gave me the method of storing PCB info in a vector and helped me with some syntax related to the vector library.
Wrote both functions I asked it to with no issues.
It also helped with errors as they appeared when testing mostly syntax related.
